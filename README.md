# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: incorrect use of the `$group` operator leading to inaccurate results.  The bug involves an aggregation pipeline intended to find the top 10 documents based on a sum of a field.  The incorrect implementation causes an inaccurate sum, resulting in incorrect top 10 results.  The solution provides the correct implementation.

## Bug Description
The provided aggregation pipeline is designed to retrieve the top 10 documents based on the sum of a particular field.  However, due to an error in the `$group` stage, the summation is incorrect, leading to inaccurate results.  This results in the top 10 documents not being accurately reflected.

## Solution
The solution corrects the error in the aggregation pipeline, ensuring the correct sum is calculated for each group and the top 10 documents are accurately identified. The updated pipeline properly calculates the sum and retrieves the top 10 documents correctly.
